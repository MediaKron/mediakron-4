      <p>This message is telling you that MediaKron as found changes that weren't saved for some reason (maybe your browser crashed or you accidentally left the page) and it's giving you the option to either keep them or discard them.</p> 	
      <p>If you're not sure if you want to keep the changes, you night want to save them just to be safe, since all versions are tracked in MediaKron and you can go back to a previous version if you need to</p>
